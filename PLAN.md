# AI Game Narrative Generator — Delivery Plan (v0.1)
_Date: 2025-08-28 • Owner: PM/Tech Lead • Status: Draft_

## 0) One-liner
**“Dynamic AI-driven worlds where CrewAI agents collaborate to create branching storylines, quests, and dialogue—tailored to each player’s choices.”**

## 1) Goals & Non-Goals (V1)
**Goals**
- Multi‑agent narrative generation (Story Architect, Lore Keeper, Quest Designer, Dialogue Writer) with explainable traces.
- Branching story arcs and quest chains with conditions, rewards, and outcomes.
- Procedural NPC dialogue that adapts to backstory, quest state, and player choices.
- Lore encyclopedia with canon enforcement and evolving faction dynamics.
- Player‑impact simulation (reputation, alignment) influencing subsequent content.
- Exports: JSON/YAML story graphs, dialogue trees, quest schemas; PDF/HTML design docs.

**Non-Goals**
- Full game engine/runtime; this is a content generation and design tool.
- Replacing human writers/designers; human review & edits are first‑class.
- Voice acting/TTS pipelines (only emit tone/emotion tags for integration).

## 2) Scope
**In-scope**
- Project management for multiple games; role‑based collaboration.
- Agent orchestration with guardrails (themes, tone, age rating).
- Narrative graph building + visualization; dialogue tree editing.
- Lore consistency checks + faction/reputation systems for simulation.
- Export pipelines to common formats (Unity/Unreal friendly).
- Observability, auditability, and per‑project encryption.

**Out-of-scope**
- Live in‑game runtime behaviors (AI directors, combat systems).
- Marketplace/distribution of narrative packs.

## 3) Workstreams & Success Criteria
1. **Agent Orchestration & Workers** — ✅ CrewAI agents wired through NATS; idempotent jobs; traces stored for review.  
2. **Narrative Graph & Quests** — ✅ Arcs/quests with branching conditions; no broken chains; graph export validated.  
3. **Dialogue & Characters** — ✅ Adaptive dialogue trees with emotion/tone tags; NPC memory.  
4. **Lore & Simulation** — ✅ Canon checks pass; player reputation/alignment change downstream content.  
5. **Frontend & Exports** — ✅ Story map, quest editor, dialogue tree, simulation viewer; exports (JSON/YAML/PDF/HTML).  
6. **SRE & Governance** — ✅ OTel traces, dashboards; RLS + audit logs; content filters enforced.

## 4) Milestones (~10–12 weeks)
- **Weeks 1–2**: Infra, schemas, RBAC/RLS, NATS bus, base workers scaffolding.  
- **Weeks 3–4**: Story/quest pipelines; story map graph model; FE StoryMap/QuestEditor MVP.  
- **Weeks 5–6**: Dialogue writer + DialogueTree UI; character profiles; emotion/tone tags.  
- **Weeks 7–8**: Lore Keeper checks; reputation/alignment simulation + SimulationViewer.  
- **Weeks 9–10**: Exporter (JSON/YAML/PDF/HTML); hardening, observability; age‑rating filters.  
- **Weeks 11–12**: Beta polish, performance passes, red‑team content review.

## 5) Deliverables
- Running dev/staging/prod environments with blue/green deploys.
- OpenAPI 3.1 spec; TypeScript SDK; Postman collection.
- Narrative pack samples; demo project with 2 arcs, 6 quests, 3 NPCs.
- Playwright E2E + integration pipeline tests.
- SRE dashboards + runbooks (DLQ drain, kill‑switches).

## 6) Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Incoherent branching or dead ends | High | Graph validation, topological checks, simulator smoke tests |
| Lore contradictions | High | Lore Keeper gating before commit/export; embeddings + rules |
| Content policy violations (age rating) | High | Thematic/tone guardrails + classifier filters; manual review queue |
| Latency spikes for large graphs | Medium | Caching hot branches; batch generation; Neo4j optional |
| Editor UX complexity | Medium | Progressive disclosure; template quest patterns; keyboard ops |

## 7) Acceptance Criteria
- Average branching factor ≥ 3 per arc; no broken quest chains in exported graphs.
- Lore consistency errors < 5% at export; zero P0 policy violations in staging.
- Dialogue generation faithfulness ≥ 90% to lore and quest state.
- Export p95: story graph < 5s, 10‑node dialogue tree < 4s.
- Median time‑to‑playable quest pack < 15 minutes from new project.

## 8) Rollout
- Private pilot with 2 studios + 1 indie cohort.
- Beta with content filters + review queue enabled.
- GA with example packs and documentation.
